* Chrmothripsis
  - Probability of occurrence
    - Altered if given gene(s) mutated?
  - Fraction of genome affected: chrt_frac
  - check chromosomal instability papers of Michor
  - Simpler: a vector: 
    - if length one, that is constant prob of chromothr.
    - if length genes, cond. prob of chromothr if that gene mutated
    - this is a named vector of more than one element, or a single element
      unnamed vector

      - Modify: "obtainMutations" in new_restrict.cpp
    


* Mutator genotype

  - If gene mutated, then increased mutation rate in all genome.
