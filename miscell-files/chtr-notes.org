* Chrmothripsis
  - This can be enabled if we want to allow for double/triple/whatever
    mutations in a single sweep. Start from a genotype with the "chtr
    gene" mutated. 
  - Probability of occurrence
    - Altered if given gene(s) mutated?
  - Fraction of genome affected: chrt_frac
  - check chromosomal instability papers of Michor
  - Simpler: a vector: 
    - if length one, that is constant prob of chromothr: this is
      silly. Chtr is always happens conditional on something happening.
    - if length genes, cond. prob of chromothr if that gene mutated
    - this is a named vector of more than one element, or a single element
      unnamed vector

      - Modify: "obtainMutations" in new_restrict.cpp
      - How is the vector for chromothripsis?

  - Chtr should only happen at reproduction. It should be modeled as
    follows:
    - clone gets hit a a chtr gene;
    - clone suffers massive mutation at reproduction; 
    - modify BNB so next "mutation" event time for this new clone is given
      by birth. Would need to get this from carefully using their equation
      S14 and re-writing. I think it is enough to set g = 0, and mu =
      birth (or birth + previous mu ---probably this last one). Then, as
      soon as a birth happens, we get the new species.
      - Beware with C++ code and birth being == 0 (a kludge would be to
        set birth to the minimal non-zero).
    - Alternatively: if clone gets hit, it immediately mutates. But this
      is not great.
    - Of course, this is all much simpler if we have discrete time.

  - Only once? If dealing with only once, etc:
    - if only once and parent already mutated by chtr: no effect
    - if not only once: do it using the prob. of chtr.
    - if only once and parent not already mutated: do it using the prob. of chtr.

  - Mutation mechanism: for each clone, the probability of mutation is
    \sum mu + nu, where nu is chromothr? but this seems at odds with what
    is written above.

    


* Mutator genotype

  - If gene mutated, then increased mutation rate in all genome.



* Both could be similar
  - General structure as for fitness effects:
    - Only a epist-like part, since with that we can do everything (except
      order)
      - Modules if we want or single genes
      - Arbitrary interactions or no interactions
    - Is this too complicated? Or is it actually simpler?
      - That we have modules is probably worth it.

  - For mutator, the product by which the gene-specific (or overall)
    mutation rate is multiplied

  - For chtr the fraction of genome altered.

  - Need to keep track if things got altered before (to avoid always
    multiplying if mutator, etc)?

    - Mutator:
      - Yes if update the mutation vector when creating clone.
      - Nope if we keep the very original vector and multiply when required.
    - Chtr:
      - At first reproduction after the hit, we get the multiple mutation
      - That should not happen again (or yes?)
