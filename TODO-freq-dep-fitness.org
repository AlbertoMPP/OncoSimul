* Miscell to-do in freq-dep-fitness branch

  - [ ] binary files were changed: explain:
    - OncoSimulR/data/examplesFitnessEffects.RData
    - OncoSimulR/inst/testdata_fee.RData
    - miscell-files/fee.RData

  - [ ] update to latest version of exprTk: 
    - http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html
    - https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk
  - [ ] why can't mutator effects be used?
    - this is said in the vignette (I think) and in oncoSimulIndiv.Rd
  - [ ] is stringr really needed?
  - [ ] is combn needed? (see NAMESPACE)
  - [ ] stopping conditions: allow with detectionDrivers?
  - [ ] explain in vignette why this was possible without touching OncoSimulR_init.c, RcppExports.cpp
  - [ ] double check from_genot_utils.R (why?)
  - [ ] test_mutator.R:
    - line 208: is it "genotype" or "Genotype"
  - [ ] check under Windows
  - [ ] check size of package with included exprTk
