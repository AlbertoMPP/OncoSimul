* Miscell to-do in freq-dep-fitness branch

** first
  - [X] binary files were changed: explain:
    - [X] OncoSimulR/data/examplesFitnessEffects.RData
    - [X] OncoSimulR/inst/testdata_fee.RData
    - [X] miscell-files/fee.RData

  - [X] test_mutator.R:
    - line 208: is it "genotype" or "Genotype"

  - [X] is stringr really needed? Leave it for now.
  - [X] is combn needed? (see NAMESPACE). Leave it, as it is from utils.


  - [X] update to latest version of exprTk: 
    - http://www.partow.net/programming/exprtk/index.html
    - https://github.com/ArashPartow/exprtk

  - [ ] why can't mutator effects be used?
    - this is said in the vignette (I think) and in oncoSimulIndiv.Rd


  - [ ] stopping conditions: allow with detectionDrivers?

  - [ ] explain in vignette why this was possible without touching OncoSimulR_init.c, RcppExports.cpp

  - [ ] double check from_genot_utils.R (why?)

  - [ ] check under Windows: failing in appveyor
    - C:/Rtools/mingw_32/bin/../lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/4.9.3/../../../../i686-w64-mingw32/bin/as.exe: new_restrict.o: too many sections
    - C:/Rtools/mingw_32/bin/../lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/4.9.3/../../../../i686-w64-mingw32/bin/as.exe: new_restrict.o: too many sections (39193)
    - solution?

         https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43306492/eigen-eigenvalues-too-many-sections-with-mingw-w64
         [above flags might take forever?]
      - Not possible to force -O3?

      - https://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/too-many-sections/6261   [R specific?]

  - [ ] check size of package with included exprTk

** second
  - [ ] isn't frequencyType redundant? Couldn't we guess if from "f" or "n"?
  - [ ] can we mix freq. with absolute? I guess so, because any frequency
    can be expressed as a ratio of numbers.
  - [ ] change frequencyType = unemployed by NULL.
