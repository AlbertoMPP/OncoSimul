The code in src/randutils.h is copyright Melissa E. O'Neill, and is
licensed under "The MIT License (MIT)" in the terms explained in the file
itself. The file randutils.hpp was downloaded from
https://gist.github.com/imneme/540829265469e673d045 on 2015-06-20 and is
also referenced from the main article
http://www.pcg-random.org/posts/ease-of-use-without-loss-of-power.html.  I
(RDU) have renamed it to randutils.h (to comply with R) and have changed
the line

auto exit_func = hash(&_Exit);

by

auto exit_func = hash(&getenv);

to keep R from complaining about using the Exit function.
